Assignment Description: "Implement an algorithm in the language of your choice (C, C++ or Python)that determines the weight of a MST in a graph G=(V,E)where the vertices are points in the plane and the weight of the edge between each pair of points is the Euclidean distance between those points.To avoid floating point precision problems in computing the square-root, we will always round the distance to the nearest integer."
